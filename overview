Our web application is a lightweight, confidential, and multilingual tool that provides empathetic, AI-powered support to Indian youth aged 15-24. Its main purpose is to offer anonymous, culturally sensitive, first-step support and, when needed, to safely route users to professional help. The application is a non-medical tool, designed to support, not to diagnose or replace clinical care. We measure its success through three key performance indicators: the number of daily active users, the percentage of crisis flags detected, and the helpful-feedback rate from our users.
